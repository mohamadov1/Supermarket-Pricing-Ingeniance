Supermarket Pricing :<br>
The problem domain is something seemingly simple: pricing goods at<br>
supermarkets.
<br>
Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans<br>
costs $0.65. Other things have more complex prices. For example:<br>
•     three for a dollar (so what’s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)<br>
•     $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)<br>
•     buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)<br>
<br>
The exercise is to experiment with a model that is flexible enough<br>
to deal with these (and other) pricing schemes, and at the same time<br>
are generally usable how do you keep an audit trail of pricing<br>
decisions.<br>
